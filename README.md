## Overview

I created a web app that lets users view and leave a comment on the latest news that I scraped from HuffPost.

## Technologies Used

Node.js,
Morgan,
Express + Express Handlebars
Mongoose
Cheerio
Axios
Other NPM command line utility + packages

## Functionality

App functionality depends on cheerio to process the returned html, mongoose to initialize and store information on the database, and express handlebars to deliver that information to the client. The user has the opportunity to add a comment under their chosen article.

## Future Development

- Allow multiple comments to be stored
- Add a delete button
- Convert CSS to SCSS
- Scrape multiple websites at a time for a wider range of articles
