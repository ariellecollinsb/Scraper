## Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## Technologies Used

Node.js,
Morgan,
Express + Express Handlebars
Mongoose
Cheerio
Axios
Other NPM command line utility + packages

## Functionality

App functionality depends on user input and table data.
The table is printed to the screen.
The user has the option to input a new burger name, or devour an existing one.
A delete button allows the user to delete any burger they don't like from the list.

## Future Development

- Convert CSS to SCSS
